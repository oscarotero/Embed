As a winner of BBC Introducing, resulting in air play nationally, he has recently achieved widespread public attention following the video release of his percussive folk rendition of Guns N’ Roses track Paradise City. Not only did this go viral on social media, it was endorsed by the band themselves and has achieved recognition and air play from several US radio stations.
